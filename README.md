GoMUD - a basic MUD server in Go 
================================

GoMUD is a WIP, currently it is a basic echo server. At the moment
go-gb is the supported way of building the server. Basically it's a
project to assist us in learning the Go programming language, but
hopefully it will become a viable MUD base alternative.
